  <h3>R</h3>
  
  <p> 
    <b>R</b> and <b>RStudio</b> are two separate pieces of software:
    <p> R is a programming language that is especially powerful for data exploration, visualization, and statistical analysis.
    
    RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) that makes using R easier. In this course we use RStudio to interact with R.</p>
    
    <p>If you don't already have R and RStudio installed, follow the instructions for your operating system below. You have to install R before you install RStudio.</p>
    
    <p>If you do have R and R studio installed, Open RStudio, and click on “Help” > “Check for updates”. If a new version is available, quit RStudio, and download the latest version for RStudio.
    
    To check which version of R you are using, start RStudio and the first thing that appears in the console indicates the version of R you are running. 
    Alternatively, you can type sessionInfo(), which will also display which version of R you are running. Go on the CRAN website (<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/">Windows</a>, <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/">MacOS</a>)
    and check whether a more recent version is available. If so, please download and install it. You can check here for more information on how to remove old versions from your <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/rw-FAQ.html#How-do-I-UNinstall-R_003f">Windows system if you wish to do so</a>.</p>

          <li>Note that if you have separate user and admin accounts, you should run the
          installers as administrator (right-click on .exe file and select "Run as
          administrator" instead of double-clicking). Otherwise problems may occur later,
            for example when installing R packages.</li>

        <p> You can download the binary files for your distribution from <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/index.html">CRAN</a>. 
          For most distributions, you could use your package manager (e.g., for Debian/Ubuntu run sudo apt-get install r-base, and for Fedora sudo yum install R), but we don’t recommend this approach as the versions provided by this are usually out of date. In any case, make sure you have at least R 3.5.1.
          Also, please install the <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download">RStudio IDE</a>.
          Once it’s installed, open RStudio to make sure it works and you don’t get any error messages.

  <h3>Python</h3>

  <p>
    <a href="https://python.org">Python</a> is a popular language for
    research computing, and great for general-purpose programming as
    well.  Installing all of its research packages individually can be
    a bit difficult, so we recommend
    <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual">Anaconda</a>,
    an all-in-one installer.
  </p>

  <p>
    Regardless of how you choose to install it,
    <strong>please make sure you install Python version 3.7 or 3.8 </strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    We will teach Python using the <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter Notebook</a>,
    a programming environment that runs in a web browser (Jupyter Notebook will be installed by Anaconda). For this to work you will need a reasonably
    up-to-date browser. The current versions of the Chrome, Safari and
    Firefox browsers are all
    <a href="https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebook.html#browser-compatibility">supported</a>
    (some older browsers, including Internet Explorer version 9
    and below, are not).

          <li>Open <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual">Anaconda Installers</a> with your web browser.</li>
          <li>Download the Anaconda for Windows installer with Python 3.8. (If you are not sure which version to choose, you probably want the 64-bit Graphical Installer <em>Anaconda3-...-Windows-x86_64.exe</em>)</li>
          <li>Install Python 3 by running the Anaconda Installer, using the recommended settings. <b>Make sure that Register Anaconda as my default Python 3.x option is checked – it should be in the latest version of Anaconda.</b>.</li>

          <li>Download the Anaconda Installer with Python 3.8 for macOS (you can either use the Graphical or the Command Line Installer).</li>
          <li>Download the Anaconda Python 3 installer for macOS. These instructions assume that you use the graphical installer .pkg file.</li>
          <li>Follow the Anaconda Python 3 installation instructions. Make sure that the install location is set to “Install only for me” so Anaconda will install its files locally, relative to your home directory. 
            Installing the software for all users tends to create problems in the long run and should be avoided.</li>

          <li>Download the Anaconda Installer with Python 3.8 for Linux.<br>
